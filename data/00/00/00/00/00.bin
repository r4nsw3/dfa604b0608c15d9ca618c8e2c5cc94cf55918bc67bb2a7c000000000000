  |   From the makers of Heavenly Sword, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West,     |
  |   and DmC: Devil May Cry, comes a warrior's brutal journey into myth    |
  |   and madness.                                                          |

  |   Set in the Viking age, a broken Celtic warrior embarks on a           |
  |   haunting vision quest into Viking Hell to fight for the soul of her   |
  |   dead lover.                                                           |

  |   Created in collaboration with neuroscientists and people who          |
  |   experience psychosis, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice will pull you      |
  |   deep into Senua's mind.                                               |

  |   Repack Notes:                                                         |
  |   We forgot to create the "exefs" folder in the rar in our previous     |
  |   release package. To make it easier for you, we have created it for    |
  |   you. Sorry for the mistake!                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   This game was built using SDK 7.3.2.0 and thus seems to be using      |
  |   different MmuFlags than current NSOs, which is the reason this game   |
  |   fails on the known CFW solutions (SXOS, Atmosphere, ReiNX, etc.)      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Until these CFW are updated to fix this, we present our solution:     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   To install this CFW FIX, you need to unrar our release on the root    |
  |   of your SDCARD. Depending on your OS, it could overwrite existing     |
  |   sxos + atmosphere folders on your SDCARD, so make sure you merge      |
  |   it or have a backup. If you are using exFAT, you might run into       |
  |   the archive bit issue. Instructions to set it up depends on the OS.   |
  |   You can skip the following steps if your SD is formatted as FAT32.    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   On Windows :                                                          |
  |   1. Select the sxos/atmosphere folders at the root of your SD card.    |
  |   2. Right click the items and select "Properties".                     |
  |   3. Select "Advanced...". Untick the "Folder is ready for archiving"   |
  |      checkbox, then click "OK".                                         |
  |   4. Click "Apply". When the confirmation dialog comes up, select:      |
  |      "Apply changes to this folder, subfolders and files", click "OK".  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   On UNIX/OSX based systems type these two commands on the terminal :   |
  |   sudo chflags -R arch /Volumes/YOURSDVOLUME/sxos                       |
  |   sudo chflags -R arch /Volumes/YOURSDVOLUME/atmosphere                 |
  |                                                                         |
